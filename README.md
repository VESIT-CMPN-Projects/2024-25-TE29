# üö® RescueNow

**RescueNow** is a mobile application designed to revolutionize emergency response following road accidents. Leveraging smartphone sensors and real-time data sharing, the app ensures timely assistance even when victims are unable to call for help.

## üì± Overview

RescueNow automatically detects severe vehicle impacts using the device‚Äôs accelerometer and GPS data. If the user doesn‚Äôt respond within a short window, the app immediately sends an alert to emergency services with the precise location of the accident.

This system ensures that:
- Accidents are reported even if victims are unconscious or unable to act
- EMS, police, and hospitals receive accurate, real-time information
- Victims are directed to the most suitable hospital based on emergency capacity and specialization
